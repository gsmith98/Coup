Coup, the popular board game of deception and manipulation. Play against friends and opponents from around the world!

My team and I create this game to compete in a gaming app hackathon hosted by Horizons School of Technology.  In this project, we use socket.io, react-native, mongodb, node, and express. The following are instruction on how the game works:
