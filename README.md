Master the character specific abilities to win: 
1. The Captain can steal from your opponents and block incoming steals. 
2. The Assassin can assassinate another player card. 
3. The Contessa can block assassination attempts. 
4. The Duke can claim tax and earn three coins. 
5. The Ambassador can exchange cards and block steals.

But bear in mind all character cards start face down! You'll have to know exactly when to lie about your cards -- and when to call out your opponents for lying -- to achieve victory!

Here are detailed rules of the game
